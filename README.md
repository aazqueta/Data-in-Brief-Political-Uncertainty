The raw count of articles for each topic corresponds to the topic with the highest share. As described in the paper:
"Building each time series requires a few extra steps. First, we label each article according to its most representative topic (the topic with the highest percentage in the article). Next, we produce a raw count of the number of news articles for every topic each month (20 raw time-series). Finally, since the number of news articles is not constant over time, we divide each raw time-series by the total number of news articles containing the word today each month (the proxy for the total number of news articles, see Azzimonti (2018))"
