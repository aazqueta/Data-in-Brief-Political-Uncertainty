The raw count of articles for each topic corresponds to the topic with the highest share. As described in the paper:
"Building each time series requires a few extra steps. First, we label each article according to its most representative topic (the topic with the highest percentage in the article). Next, we produce a raw count of the number of news articles for every topic each month (20 raw time-series). Finally, since the number of news articles is not constant over time, we divide each raw time-series by the total number of news articles containing the word today each month (the proxy for the total number of news articles, see Azzimonti (2018))"

There are two sheets in the Excel file. The first sheet called "Count_Proportion" contains the news associated to each topic (News), the total number of news that contain the word "today" (Total News) and the proportion of news over the total number of news (Propo). This is information is monthly and goes from January 2008 until June 2017. The total news associated to each topic for the period January 1998 until June 2017 is cotnained in the second Excel sheet called Count.
